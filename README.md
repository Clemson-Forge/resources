# Resources
Welcome to the Clemson Forge resources repo!

Clemson Forge was created with the idea that everyone needs some form advice or help to excel one's career path. In making this repo we are supporting that belief through providing essential resources to assist CS students through out the career preparation process. We encourage students to use this repo as a starting point for whatever stage they are on and continue that stage through their own self studies. 

We are looking to regularly update this GitHub and ask your help to contribute any resources/sections that have or would have helped you in the past.

## Interview Prep
Preparing for the technical interview or pre-screening can often times be the most crucial step for landing any sort of tech position. These technical interview focus largely on DSA concepts which need to be nailed down. 
Leetcode will be one of the best resources for this offering thousands of sample questions that are often times used in real interviews. To assist in tackling the different concepts covered in these questions, publicly available question lists can be found which contain a good guideline of questions to complete to understand each DSA concept (hashing, trees, maps, etc).

## Internship & Programs List
Apart from popular job board websites, there are a couple other resources to stay posted with for internships and programs. More links are to come as recruiting season comes closer.

### Why fellowships and other programs?
For many freshmen and sophomores, landing an internship is quite difficult and challenging; however there exists early career events and programs companies hold meant exclusively for these underclassmen. Applying and participating in opportunities such as these are amazing ways to showcase to companies that you are actively putting effort into your career growth.
