# Resources
Welcome to the Clemson Forge Resources Repo!

Clemson Forge was created with the belief that every student benefits from guidance and support throughout their CS journey. This repo was made to support that belief by centralizing essential resources to help you grow—whether you're learning a new language, starting a project, or preparing for your next interview.

We encourage contributions from students at all levels: if you’ve found a resource that helped you, chances are it can help someone else too.

## Learning
Learning different programming languages and specializations is an essential step in helping develop your CS portfolio. There are many different ways to learn a language. These include YouTube tutorials, interactive platforms, and free online courses from top universities. Below is a compilation of good sources we've found:

## Interview Prep
### Technical Interviews
Preparing for the technical interview or pre-screening can oftentimes be the most crucial step for landing any sort of tech position. These technical interviews focus largely on DSA concepts, which need to be nailed down.  
  
Leetcode will be one of the best resources for this offering, thousands of sample questions that are often used in real interviews. Mastering technical interviews takes time, practice, and strategy. Below are curated resources to help you nail these interviews!

## Internship & Programs List
Apart from popular job board websites, there are a couple of other resources to stay posted with for internships and programs. More links are to come as the recruiting season comes closer.

| Source | Description |

| [Simplify's Repo](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships) | One of the most popular repo's for internship applications, updated on the daily during recruiting season. |

### Why fellowships and other programs?
For many freshmen and sophomores, landing an internship is quite difficult and challenging; however, there exist early career events and programs companies hold meant exclusively for these underclassmen. Applying and participating in opportunities such as these are amazing ways to showcase to companies that you are actively putting effort into your career growth.
